1.	The Harvard Architecture:
  The Harvard architecture is a computer architecture with physically separate storage and signal pathways for
instructions and data so it is possible to access program memory and data memory simultaneously.
  These early machines had data storage entirely contained within the central processing unit, and provided no
access to the instruction storage as data. Programs needed to be loaded by an operator of the machine because the
processor could not initialize itself.
  A characteristic of the Harvard Architecture is that it has physically separate signals and storage for code and data memory. 

     Advantages:
 -By having two memories it allows parallel access to data and instructions.
 -The instructions and the data are accessed in the same way resulting in a faster execution time.
 -It is possible to make extremely fast memory, but this is only practical for small amounts of memory because
of the expensive production cost.

     Disadvantages:
 -Not widely used.
 -More difficult and expensive to build as it requires more pins.
