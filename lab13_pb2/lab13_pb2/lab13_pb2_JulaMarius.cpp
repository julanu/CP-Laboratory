	Description: Define an enumeration called White_Light that will contain the basic colors (red,
orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet). Initialize a few variables of type
White_Light and try to generate some secondary colors by combining the basic colors
mentioned above. Use an enumeration based mechanism for translating the color
names into French, English or German. Display all the colors mentioning the
original- and the translated names and the associated value.
